# Electronic-Voting-Machine
 An EVM is capable of saving considerable printing stationery and transport of large volumes of electoral material. It is easy to transport, store, and maintain. It
completely rules out the chance of invalid votes. Use of an EVM results in reduction of polling time, resulting in fewer problems in electoral preparations, law and order candidates' expenditure, etc. and easy and accurate counting without any mischief at the counting centre.

This project is a basic prototype of an Electronic Voting machine which can be used by voters to vote for their respective candidates.The Electronic Voting Machine is
microcontroller based having facility of storing of votes of four candidates by pressing switches, options of display in LCD the votes, total result etc.

Simulation of EVM is performed in **Proteus** and Assembly level code is written using **KEIL** Software
